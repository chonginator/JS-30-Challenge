  Questions:

  - What should you register an event handler on when an event is
  not associated with any particular DOM element, like a key press? document?
  window?
    - It doesn't seem to really matter, as long as it supports the event handler
    you're looking to create. 'document' and 'window' both support 'keydown'
    event handlers. The full lists can be found here:
       https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window#Event_handlers
       https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document#Event_handlers
  - What's the difference between keydown, keypress and keyup events?
    - A keypress event has been replaced by keydown. A keydown event is fired when a
    key is pressed. A key up event is fired when a key is released.
  - What's the difference between a DOMString (returned by .code) and a regular
  String?
    - For all practical purposes, they are essentially the same thing.
  - Why don't you need curly braces for an inline if statement?
    - For single-line statements, it's a matter of personal preference as they
    work with curly braces or not. Why it works is another question.
  - How do you make the audio more responsive to key presses?
    - The reason why it is unresponsive to multiple successive key presses is
    because an audio file that is already playing won't be played again. So the
    solution is to set the audio file back to the beginning whenever a keypress
    occurs. Note that this is before play() is called so that successive key
    presses will reset the audio file before playing it again
  - When adding and removing the class of 'playing' on a key <div>, how do you
    make it not get removed so fast, so that the proper styles can actually be
    applied?
      - It turns out that you can listen for the end of a CSS transition, called
      'transitionend'. This event is a part of the HTMLElement interface.

  - When testing whether a value is empty, you can just use the negation logical
  operator (!), instead of something like == null or != null
